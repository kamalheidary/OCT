# OCT
optical coherence tomography analysis by using Matlab


Here I uploaded a Matlab function for analysing interference spectrum for optical coherence tomography.

This code developed by me as a part of my MSc thesis and for doing that, I used a book that name is "optical coherence tomography technology and applications".

If there was a comment about that, please feel free to contact me.

Bests,
Kamal
